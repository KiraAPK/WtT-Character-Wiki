  <h2>Lore</h2>
  <p>Emissary was originally created to be a more effective messenger, carrying the wings of a Vulture, and the long legs of a Rain Deer. <br>
This however, did not work out as planned. Who knew that combining a hostile carnivore with a chill herbivore might be a bad idea. While yes, it proved to be amazing at its job, it would occasionally eat those it delivered to.<br> 

im thinking like the people creating it pulled a "okay this is an issue we should probably stop using it to send things."<br>
could be connected to the slugcats and scavengers by helping the two trade amongst themselves, or between one another.<br>
It still has a bad habit of eating the people it receives things from, or delivers to, but its trying to work on it.<br>
It can communicate with slugcats and scavengers, but not well. Preferring to use movements and short sentences or singular words.<br>
It genuinely likes its friends. Much to its dismay, its friends look mighty tasty.</p>
  <h2>Rounds featured in</h2>
  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>Emissary was featured in Round 3, where they were a Veteran. Though they never killed anyone, they were a help to the town nonetheless, having helped find the Medusa.</p>
