  <h2>Lore</h2>
  <p>An odd scavenger, he doesn't act very normal and while the others notice they don't usually stop him.<br>

Unless he's holding a bomb.<br>

He loves bombs and explosives. He prefers them so much more to spears. He'll even hunt with them! Though he rarely hunts and prefers easy meals like fruit and popcorn plants. He's close friends with The Tamer as they had grown up together in the same tribe. After wandering around, he came across The Seeker and Helpful, and befriended (one of) them.<br>

Despite his airheadedness and carefree persona, Berry sometimes worries about his friends. He worries they might get hurt, or die. And he worries they might not like him.</p>
  <h2>Rounds featured in</h2>
  <h3>Round 3</h3>
  <p>Berry is featured in Round 3, where he was a Jailor. Despite his personality, he ruled with an iron fist and led the town to victory with help from Seeker.</p>
