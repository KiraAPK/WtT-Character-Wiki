            <p>Welcome to Town is a social deduction or murder mystery game server, heavily inspired by <i>Town of Salem,</i> in which players are randomly and privately assigned a faction and role. Each of these factions has its specific win conditions that players must work together to achieve, typically the elimination of another faction. But who can you trust? Because roles are secret, players often lie and fake claim roles to prevent themselves from being executed. It is up to you to deduce who is friend and who is foe.</p>
